*** Content-addressable names ***

The Git object store is organized and implemented as a content-addressable
storage syztem. Specifically, each object in the object store has a unique
name produced by applying SHA1 to the contents of the object, yielding and SHA1
hash value. Because the complete contents of an object contribute to the hash 
value and the hash value is believed to be effectively unique to that particular
content, the SHA1 hash is sufficient index or name for that object in the object
database. Any tiny  hange to a file xauses the SHA1 hash to change, causing the new version of the file to be indexed separately.
