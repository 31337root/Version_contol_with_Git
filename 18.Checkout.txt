*** Creating and checking out a new branch ***

Another fairly common scenario happens when you want to both create a new branch and simultaneously switch to it as well. Git provides a shitcut for this with the -b -new-branch option.

Is exactly the same as the two-command sequence:
	git branch new-branch start-point
	git checkout new-branch
