*** Commits ***

In Git, a commit is used to record changes to a repository.

Git commit operates in a unique way.

Whean a commit occurs, Git records a snapshot of the index and places that 
snapshot in the object store. This snapshot does not contin a copy of every
file and directory in the index, because such a strategy would require enormous
and pohibitive amounts of storage. Inatead, Git compares the current state of 
the index tot he previous snapshot and so derives a list of affectd files and
directories. Git creates new blobs for any file that has changed and new trees 
for any directory that has changed, and it reuses any blob or tree object that
has not changed.
