*** File classifications in Git ***

Git classifies your files into three groups: tracked, ignored, and untracked.

	Tracked
		A tracked file is any file already in the repository or any file
		that is staged in the index. To add a new file to this group,
		run git add somefile.
	Ignored
		An ignored file most be explicitly declared invisible or ignored
		in the repository even tgough it may be present within your
		working directory. A software project tends to have foog number
		of ignored files. Common ignored files include temporary and
		scratch files, personal notes, compiler output, and most files
		generated automatically during a build. Git maintains a default
		list of files to ignore, and oy can configura your repository
		to recognize others.
	Untracked
		An untracked file is any file not found in either of the
		previous two categories. Git considers the entire set of files
		in your working directory and subtracts both the tracked files
		and ignored files to yeild what is untracked.
