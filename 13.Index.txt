*** Index ***
The index is a temporary and dynamic binady file that describes the directory
structure of the entire repository. More specifically, the index captures a 
version of the project's overall structure at some moment in time.
The project's state could be represented by a commit and a tree from any point
in the project's history, or it could be a future state toward which you are
actively developing.

-------------------->
	Here's how it works. As the developer, you execute Git commands to stage
	changes in the index. Changes usually add, delete, or edit some file
	or set of files. The index records and retains those chanfes, kepping
	them safe until you are ready to commit them. You can also remove or 
	replace changes in the index. Thus, the index allows a gradual 
	transition, usually guided by you, from one complex repository state to
	another, presumable better state.
